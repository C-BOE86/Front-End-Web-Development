            <p>I give this Semester a 9 out of 10. Yep, you heard me ladies and gentleman. I relearned some things from this semester and it was a pleasure meeting our
instructor Doug.</p>
			<br>
			<p>Why am I commenting on what I think about the semester? That answer is
			simple....... "Because I can!!!!!"<palign=center><img src="smile.jpg"></p>
			<br>
			<p>Here is a brief list of my experience if you want more please refer to my resume page.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>I am currently a Junior .Net Developer for Brown Shoe Company, I must say that it is an honor and a privilege to work for a company that has
				been around for at least a 100 years.</li>
				<br>
                <li> Before I became a Professional Coder I was a Technican at Connected LLC, I sometimes
				miss that job because it required me to use lots of different technology.</li>
					<br>
                <li> I have been a student at UMSL since 2011, its a good school, however, I am growing tired of being here as a student, mainly
				because I want to be in workforce doing something that I really want to do and to quote Steve Jobs, "Stay Hungry, Stay Foolish".
				Please look more about UMSL at my <a href="umsl.html">UMSL Page.</a></li>
					<br> 
                <li> This Line is just an extra line, for something for me to say, I really don't have anything to say; 
				you know always making scene simply "Because I Can!!!".</li>
            </ul>
