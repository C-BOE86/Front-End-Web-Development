            <p>Yep, UMSL is the name of my school look at it, the Student Center really is something to look at.</p>
			
            <ul>
                <li>I learned how to be a outstanding working citizen of my society.</li>
				<br>
                <li>I learned how think on my feet at the University, by that I mean quick witted, talkative, and resourceful with my time.</li>
				<br>
                <li>I also learned that it was a good "Bang For Your Buck" school, "Really" I mean that, unlike other schools, UMSL didn't charge me
				an arm and a leg and fortunately my debt won't be large upon graduation.</li>
				<br>
                <li>I learned the most important listen of all, how to have fun even when some of the professors won't allow 
				the class to be fun.</li>
				<br>
				<li> UMSL is also where I started being a puppeteer, are you ready for <a href="videos.html">"The Final Show?"</a> </li>
